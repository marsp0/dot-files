[workspace dirs]
/home/martin/Documents/Projects/pbr-software-renderer
# These directories will be scanned when a workspace is opened so that search etc. works.
# Example:
# C:/projects/my-project
# C:/jai


# IMPORTANT:
# You can override any section from the global config in your project and it will be used when your project is active.
# Please note that some of the sections will completely replace the ones in the global config, while other sections
# will try to merge with the global config. E.g. the workspace sections such as [ignore dirs] will completely
# override the global [ignore dirs], which allows you to "unignore" some dirs just for your project!
# Empty sections are ignored.
